            <p class="m-2">My name is Casey, I was born and raised in Montreal, Canada where I spent most
               of my life. I graduated highschool in 2012 and immediatly went to college to
                study in social sciences. After a little over a year I decided to drop out.
                This program was not for me. I decided to jump into a coding class, something
                I had never done before. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="m-2">After 3 years of writing lines and debugging I finally finished this
                 program and did an internship for 2 months to aquire external experience. The
                  internship went very well but unfortunatly the company did not had the budget to hire
                   me. A few month later, I decided to pack my things and drive down to Orlando where
                    I now live.
                 </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p class="m-2">Here I am, taking this new coding class to improve my skills even further and potentialy
               launch my career as a full-stack developer. But for now I currently work as a server in
                a wine bar downtown Orlando trying to make the best out of it. Oh and this is a picture
                 of my cat (who is also Canadian).</p>
